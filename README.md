# Replication-of-research-perfomred-on-data-from-Mexico-payment-for-ecosystem-services-program
This is a replication study of Only One Tree from Each Seed? Environmental Effectiveness and Poverty Alleviation in Mexico’s Payments for Ecosystem Services Program. We use data from Mexico’s Payment for Hydrological Services Program to confirm that payment for ecosystem services is an effective means at improving forest coverage and density. We found that once we used control variables for regional and yearly differences, the payment for ecosystems service program increased forest coverage by very significant margins.
